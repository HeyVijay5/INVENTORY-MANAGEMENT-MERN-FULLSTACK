# Inventory Management System (MERN Stack)

## Overview

The **Inventory Management System** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This system allows businesses or individuals to efficiently manage and track their inventory. Users can add, update, delete, and view products, track stock levels, and perform various inventory-related tasks in a user-friendly interface.

The project aims to help businesses streamline their inventory processes and ensure real-time updates on stock availability, reducing manual errors and improving overall workflow efficiency.

## Features

### **User Authentication**
- **Login and Registration**: Secure login and registration functionality for both admins and users.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens for secure, token-based authentication.

### **Inventory Management**
- **Add Products**: Admin users can add new products to the inventory with essential details like name, description, price, quantity, and image.
- **Edit Products**: Admin users can update product details like price, description, and quantity.
- **Delete Products**: Admin users can remove products from the inventory.
- **View Products**: Both admin and regular users can view the list of products, including their details like stock level, price, and description.
  
### **Stock Management**
- **Stock Level Update**: The inventory system automatically updates stock levels when products are sold or restocked.
- **Low Stock Alerts**: The system sends notifications for products that fall below a predefined stock level, allowing admins to reorder stock in time.

### **Search and Filters**
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for products by name or SKU.
- **Filters**: Users can filter products by category, price range, and stock status.

### **Responsive UI**
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive interface built with React.js that is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

### **Admin Dashboard**
- **Product Overview**: Admin users have access to a dashboard where they can see product analytics like total stock, stock levels, and product count.
- **Order Management**: Admins can track and manage orders from customers, mark orders as shipped, and manage returns.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js (for building the user interface)
  - React Router (for client-side routing)
  - Axios (for making HTTP requests to the backend)
  - Material-UI or Bootstrap (for UI components and styling)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js (JavaScript runtime for the backend)
  - Express.js (for building RESTful APIs)
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication)
  - Bcrypt.js (for password hashing)

- **Database**:
  - MongoDB (NoSQL database for storing products, users, and orders)
  - Mongoose (for interacting with MongoDB)

- **Deployment**:
  - Heroku or DigitalOcean (for deploying the backend)
  - Netlify or Vercel (for deploying the frontend)

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-management.git
cd inventory-management
```

### 2. Install dependencies for the backend
Navigate to the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the following variables:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### 4. Run the backend
```bash
npm start
```

The backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5. Install dependencies for the frontend
Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 6. Run the frontend
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 7. Visit the application
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app. The backend should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Sign Up/Login**: Admins and users can create an account and log in using their credentials.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Once logged in, admins can manage the inventory, track products, and manage orders.
- **Add Products**: Admin users can add new products with details such as name, description, price, quantity, and images.
- **View Products**: Both admin and user roles can view the list of products and their details.
